  abstract = {PageRank is defined as the stationary state of a Markov chain. The chain is obtained by perturbing the transition matrix induced by a web graph with a damping factor α that spreads uniformly part of the rank. The choice of α is eminently empirical, and in most cases the original suggestion α = 0.85 by Brin and Page is still used. Recently, however, the behaviour of PageRank with respect to changes in α was discovered to be useful in link-spam detection[21]. Moreover, an analytical justification of the value chosen for α is still missing. In this paper, we give the first mathematical analysis of PageRank when α changes. In particular, we show that, contrarily to popular belief, for real-world graphs values of α close to 1 do not give a more meaningful ranking. Then, we give closed-form formulae for PageRank derivatives of any order, and an extension of the Power Method that approximates them with convergence O (tk αt) for the k-th derivative. Finally, we show a tight connection between iterated computation and analytical behaviour by proving that the k-th iteration of the Power Method gives exactly the PageRank value obtained using a Maclaurin polynomial of degree k. The latter result paves the way towards the application of analytical methods to the study of PageRank.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the statistically significant centrality of nodes is one of the main goals of multiplex networks. However, current centrality measures for node rankings focus only on either random walks or on the topological structure of the network. A pressing challenge is how to measure centrality of nodes in multiplex networks, depending both on network topology and on the biased types of random walks, such as the biased walks dealing with the properties of each node separately at each layer, or the biased walks considering instead one or even more intrinsically multiplex properties of the arrival node. In the paper, considering these two aspects, we propose a mathematical framework based on topologically biased random walk, called topologically biased multiplex PageRank, which allows to calculate centrality and accordingly rank nodes in multiplex networks. In particular, depending on the nature of biases and the interaction of nodes between different layers, we distinguish additive, multiplicative and combined cases of topologically biased multiplex PageRank. Each case by tuning the bias parameters reflects how the centrality ranking of a node in one layer affects the ranking its replica can gain in the other layers, and captures the extent to which the walkers preferentially visit hubs or poorly connected nodes. Experiments on two real-world multiplex networks show that the topologically biased multiplex PageRank outperforms both its corresponding unbiased case and the current ranking methods, and it can efficiently capture the significantly top-ranked nodes in multiplex networks by means of a proper tuning of the biases in the walks.},

Ten Canadian and ten American academic library Websites were sampled for pathfinders on three business topics: company, industry and marketing. Findings showed that the traditional term ‘pathfinder’ was not used on these academic Websites; instead ‘subject guides’ or ‘research guides’ were the most popular synonyms. The content analysis identified that subject guides have two basic functions, which are to facilitate access and to provide a search strategy. Four principles were found for creating Webmounted, subject guides: accessibility, consistency, selectivity, and transparency. The research also found that subject guides are important library finding tools as evidenced by the time and effort devoted to their creation, and their placement on valuable library homepage screen space.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The weights can then be used to rank the pages as authoritative sources. These algorithms share a common underpinning; they find a dominant eigenvector of a nonnegative matrix that describes the link structure of the given network and use the entries of this eigenvector as the page weights. We use this commonality to give a unified treatment, proving the existence of the required eigenvector for the PageRank, HITS, and SALSA algorithms, the uniqueness of the PageRank eigenvector, and the convergence of the algorithms to these eigenvectors. However, we show that the HITS and SALSA eigenvectors need not be unique. We examine how the initialization of the algorithms affects the final weightings produced. We give examples of networks that lead the HITS and SALSA algorithms to returnnonunique or nonintuitive rankings. We characterize all such networks in terms of the connectivity of the related HITS authority graph. We propose a modification, Exponentiated Input to HITS, to the adjacency matrix input to the HITS algorithm. We prove that Exponentiated Input to HITS returns a unique ranking, provided that the network is weakly connected. Our examples also show that SALSA can give inconsistent hub and authority weights, due to nonuniqueness. We also mention a small modification to the SALSA initialization which makes the hub and authority weights consistent.},

  abstract = {Purpose – Social media platforms allow near‐unfettered creation and exchange of user generated content (UGC). Drawing from network science, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether high and low quality UGC differ in their connectivity structures in Wikipedia (which consists of interconnected user generated articles). Design/methodology/approach – Using Featured Articles as a proxy for high quality, a network analysis was undertaken of the revision history of six different language Wikipedias, to offer a network‐centric explanation for the emergence of quality in UGC. Findings – The network structure of interactions between articles and contributors plays an important role in the emergence of quality. Specifically the analysis reveals that high‐quality articles cluster in hubs that span structural holes. Research limitations/implications – The analysis does not capture the strength of interactions between articles and contributors. The implication of this limitation is that quality is viewed as a binary variable. Extensions to this research will relate strength of interactions to different levels of quality in UGC. Practical implications – The findings help harness the “wisdom of the crowds” effectively. Organisations should nurture users and articles at the structural hubs from an early stage. This can be done through appropriate design of collaborative knowledge systems and development of organisational policies to empower hubs. Originality/value – The network centric perspective on quality in UGC and the use of a dynamic modelling tool are novel. The paper is of value to researchers in the area of social computing and to practitioners implementing and maintaining such platforms in organisations.},

This is combined with a practical path to assess the extent of difference between suggestions of current search engines versus user expectations. A user-centered, evidence-based, phenomenology approach is used to improve on Google PageRank (GPR) in two ways. The first by biasing GPR's equal navigation probability assumption using (f)actual usage stats as implicit user consensus which leads to the StatsRank (SR) algorithm. Secondly, we aggregate users' explicit ranking to derive Consensus Rank (CR) which is shown to predict individual user ranking significantly better than GPR and meta-search of modern search engines Google and Yahoo/Bing real-time. CT\&M contextualizes CR, SR, and a live open online web experiment, called {$<$}u{$>$}The Ranking Game{$<$}/u{$>$}, which is based on the August-2016 English Wikipedia corpus (12.7 million pages) and Page View Statistics for May to July 2016. Limiting this work to Wikipedia makes GPR topic-based since any Wikipedia page is focused on one topic. TREC's pooling is used to merge top 20 results from major search engines and present an alphabetized list for users' explicit ranking via drag and drop. The same platform captures implicit data for future research and can be used for controlled experiments. Our contributions are: CT\&M, SR, CR, and the open online user feedback web experiment research platform.},

  abstract = {Measurement of graph centrality provides us with an indication of the importance or popularity of each vertex in a graph. When dealing with graphs that are not centrally controlled (such as the Web, social networks and academic citation graphs), centrality measure must 1) correlate with vertex importance/popularity, 2) scale well in terms of computation, and 3) be difficult to manipulate by individuals. The Random Surfer probability transition model, combined with Eigenvalue Centrality produced PageRank, which has shown to satisfy the required properties. Existing centrality measures (including PageRank) make the assumption that all directed edges are positive, implying an endorsement. Recent work on sentiment analysis has shown that this assumption is not valid. In this article, we introduce a new method of transitioning a graph, called Power Walk, that can successfully compute centrality scores for graphs with real weighted edges. We show that it satisfies the desired properties, and that its computation time and centrality ranking is similar to when using the Random Surfer model for non-negative matrices. Finally, stability and convergence analysis shows us that both stability and convergence when using the power method, are dependent on the Power Walk parameter β.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that pairwise PageRank orders emerge from two-hop walks. The main tool used here refers to a specially designed sign-mirror function and a parameter curve, whose low-order derivative information implies pairwise PageRank orders with high probability. We study the pairwise correct rate by placing the Google matrix G in a probabilistic framework, where G may be equipped with different random ensembles for model-generated or real-world networks with sparse, small-world, scale-free features, the proof of which is mixed by mathematical and numerical evidence. We believe that the underlying spectral distribution of aforementioned networks is responsible for the high pairwise correct rate. Moreover, the perspective of this paper naturally leads to an O(1) algorithm for any single pairwise PageRank comparison if assuming both A=G−In, where In denotes the identity matrix of order n, and A2 are ready on hand (e.g., constructed offline in an incremental manner), based on which it is easy to extract the top k list in O(kn), thus making it possible for PageRank algorithm to deal with super large-scale datasets in real time.},

Though the power method is the initial measure to settle the PageRank problem, it gives poor convergence when the damping factor is sufficiently close to 1. This difficulty encourages researchers to present improved iterative methods for accelerating PageRank computations. In this paper, a cheap and practical extrapolation approach which is determined by the trace of the Google matrix is proposed, and it is more attractive when combined with the well-known Arnoldi-type algorithm. Convergence analysis of our algorithms is given. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of these accelerated schemes.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on pathfinders, from the 1970s to the present. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews a range of publications which describe the methodology of pathfinders, provide practical advice and information, present research results, to aid librarians and library administrators in how to best manage the production and marketing of pathfinders. Findings – It was found that not much has been written on pathfinders. A few articles on traditional pathfinders were published between 1972 and 1995. In 1996, the electronic format took over. Most of the articles are of a practical nature although some describe empirical research. One void in the literature that has been found is librarians' lack of knowledge of users' needs and preferences. This results in much time and effort being dedicated to the production of pathfinders but without any consideration of users, thus discouraging them from using the available resources. Practical implications – This paper will be a useful source of information for librarians. It provides an overview of guidelines and best practices currently reported in the literature as well as the latest technical and educational trends. Originality/value – Such an extensive review of the literature on pathfinders has not been done before. It provides practical information for librarians wanting to embark on the production of pathfinders. It also identifies possible areas of future study.},

  abstract = {The size of the English Wikipedia can be measured in terms of the number of articles, number of words, and the size of the database, among other ways. As of 20 August 2020, there are 6,144,070 articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 3.6 billion words.
Wikipedia continues to grow, and the number of articles in Wikipedia is increasing by over 17,000 a month. The number of articles added to Wikipedia every month reached its maximum in 2006, at over 50,000 new articles a month, and has been slowly but steadily declining since then. While this might seem to show that Wikipedia's growth is slowing or stopping, it should be noted that the amount of text added to Wikipedia articles every year has been constant since 2006, at roughly 1 gigabyte of (compressed) text added per year. This implies that as time progresses, proportionally more content is added to existing articles rather than new articles, and that Wikipedia has maintained the same persistent rate of growth throughout the past decade. In other words, over time, the average article size is growing faster than the number of articles.
Most of the earlier entries were extracted from Wikipedia:Milestones. Later entries are taken from observations of the new software's built-in article count features. For information on what Wikipedia's software counts as an article, see Wikipedia:What is an article\#Lists of articles and statistics.
The article count of bot-generated Wikipedias such as the Cebuano-language edition of Wikipedia, as well as the Swedish-, Dutch- and the Waray-language editions, grow much faster than those that are primarily written by humans such as the English Wikipedia. Swedish Wikipedian Sverker Johansson's Lsjbot is the primary author of those four primarily bot-generated Wikipedias. However, individual articles in bot-generated Wikipedias are on average much shorter than those in primarily human-written Wikipedias. Thus, article count alone is a poor indicator of the scale and scope of all Wikipedia editions.},

In this paper, we study the efficacy of, and countermeasures for, collusions designed to improve user rating in such systems.We define a metric, called the amplification factor, which captures the amount of PageRank-inflation obtained by a group due to collusions. We prove that the amplification factor can be at most 1/ε, where ε is the reset probability of the PageRank random walk. We show that colluding nodes (e.g., web-pages) can achieve this amplification and increase their rank significantly in realistic settings; further, several natural schemes to address this problem are demonstrably inadequate.We propose a relatively simple modification to PageRank which renders the algorithm insensitive to such collusion attempts. Our scheme is based on the observation that nodes which cheat do so by “stalling” the random walk in a small portion of the web graph and, hence, their PageRank must be especially sensitive to the reset probability ε. We perform exhaustive simulations on the Web graph to demonstrate that our scheme successfully prevents colluding nodes from improving their rank, yielding an algorithm that is robust to gaming.},

Identifying disease-associated pathways is of great importance to the development of novel therapeutics, as it provides functional insights into the pathogenesis of a disease. Existing methods for pathway ranking, however, are mostly based on an enrichment score assigned to each pathway independently, which could be biased by overlooking the interactions between pathways. In this paper, we consider a modification of Google's PageRank algorithm in order to fully incorporate the pathway dependencies into the pathway ranking. The proposed measurement is a trade-off between two important aspects, namely, the phenotype–pathway association and pathway coexpression. We propose to use a projection correlation to quantify pathway coexpression, and a generalized R2 for phenotype–pathway association. Our simulation study on real pathways shows the competitive performance of the new measure compared with enrichment-based analyses in pathway ranking.},

For instance, a jobseeker may want to connect with some members in LinkedIn so that recruiters can easily find him. We first propose two definitions of node discoverability. Then, we prove that the node discoverability optimization problem is NP-hard. We show that a greedy algorithm can be used to find near-optimal solutions. To scale up the algorithm on large networks, we design three methods: (1) an exact method based on dynamic programming, which is accurate but computationally inefficient; (2) an estimation method based on the framework of random walk, which is efficient but may be inaccurate; (3) an estimation-and-refinement method, which combines the previous two methods and we show that it is both accurate and efficient. Experiments conducted on real networks demonstrate that the estimation-and-refinement method can provide a good trade-off between solution accuracy and computational efficiency, and achieve speedup of up to three orders of magnitude over the exact method.},
