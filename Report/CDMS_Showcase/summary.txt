                             ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


This report looked at the emergence of ordered complex structures from
natural phenomena and iterative processes.

Primarily the investigation is concerned with fractals, complex shapes
that tend to exhibit some sort of a pattern (e.g. snowflakes and
coastlines), formally a definition for a fractal is actually quite a
nuanced problem and is not something that appears to have been
completely settled in the literature something discussed within the
report.

In order to investigate fractals this report provides methods to
generate a variety of self-similar and non-self-similar fractals and
measure a corresponding descriptive metric known as the /fractal
dimension/.
