\section{Fractals}
\label{sec:org119de15}
\subsection{Definition of a Fractal}
\label{sec:orgd7bb3b9}

Benoît Mandelbrot coined the term fractal in 1975 \cite{gomoryBenoitMandelbrot19242010} and defined it his 1982 book \emph{The Fractal Geometry of Nature} \cite[p. 15]{mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982} :

\begin{quote}
\emph{A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension
strictly exceeds the topological dimension.}

\emph{a Every set with a noninteger \(D\) is a fractal.}
\end{quote}


The topoligical dimension is a strictly integer value that describes the natural dimension used to describe a shape \cite{sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017},
for example the \emph{Koch Snowflake} (shown in figure \ref{koch-snowflake}) is composed of
just a line, so it's topological dimension would simply be 1, it's \emph{fractal
dimension} however is shown to be \(\frac{\ln\left( 4 \right)}{\ln\left( 3
\right)}\) at \eqref{eq:koch-dim} in \S\ref{topological-equivalence}.

Many authors seem to accept this earlier definition (see e.g. \cite[\S2.2]{vicsekFractalGrowthPhenomena1992} and \cite[\S2.1]{telChaoticDynamicsIntroduction2006}),
this definition however does not capture many edge-case fractals
 \cite[VII]{edgarMeasureTopologyFractal2008a} and in reprintings of \emph{The
Fractal Geometry of Nature} Mandelbrot himself commented that in hindsight it
may have been more appropriate \cite[p. 459]{mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982}:

\begin{quote}
/to leave the term ``fractal” without a pedantic definition, to use “fractal
dimension” as a generic term applicable to all the variants in Chapter 39, and
to use in each specific case whichever definition is the most appropriate./
\end{quote}

Gerald Edgar, in his 2008 book \emph{Measure, topology, and fractal geometry}
rejected this view because ``\emph{a term without a 'pedantic definition' cannot be
studied mathematically}'' \cite[VII]{edgarMeasureTopologyFractal2008a} and
presented a more robust definition in Ch. 6 of that book, it was however
accepted that the loose definition of fractal dimension is convenient and was
indeed adopted in that work.

Although reviewing the precise definition of a fractal would have been very
interesting, without a cursory knowledge of fractals generally this would have
been very time consuming and outside the scope of this report \footnote{Mandelbrot
also discussed fractals of a Euclidean and Reimannian nature,
\cite[p. 361]{mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982}, this again is interesting
but too specific for the broad nature of our investigation}. no strict
definition will be used for fractals, but, guiding principles implemented by
other authors will be used.

Some authors simply define a fractal as a shape that \emph{shows irregularities at all scales} \cite[p. 1]{gouyetPhysicsFractalStructures1996} and
in his 2003 book, \emph{Fractal Geometry}, Facloner  it is more convenient to describe a fractal by a list of properties characteristic of such shapes \footnote{Much like the definition of life in the field of biology} because of the difficulty in defining a fractal in a way that can encompass all edge cases \cite[p. xxv]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Detail at all scales
\item Cannot be described in a traditional geometric way
\item May have some form of approximate self similarity
\item Usually the fractal dimension is greater than its topological dimension
\item In many cases defined very simply, perhaps recursively
\end{itemize}

This will be the approach adopted in this report.

It's interesting to note that many authors to refer to complex natural shapes as
fractals, such as coastlines (see e.g.
\cite{jiangFractalAnalysisComplexity1998,zhuFractalMechanismCoastline2002,zhongFractalPropertiesShoreline2017})
much in the spirit of Mandelbrot's paper \emph{How long is the Coastline of Britain}
\cite{mandelbrotHowLongCoast1967}, although he coined the term fractal many years
after this paper, presumably he might have had this in mind \footnote{Mandelbrot also
spent much time looking at the roughness of financial markets and so presumably
may have had that in mind as well, see e.g.
\cite{gomoryBenoitMandelbrot19242010,mandelbrotMisBehaviourMarkets2008}} when
framing the definition so this issue in clearly defining what a fractal is
appears on the surface to be a purely mathematical one (as opposed to a
practical or applied one).

The Wikipedia page on fractals \cite{Fractal2020} also points out that a
fractal is nowhere differentiable, this would be because a fractal is
nowhere smooth, which I think personally is quite a distinguishing feature.

\subsection{Fractals Generally}
\label{sec:orgeb44da0}
Dimension is the main defining property of a fractal. As aforementioned above, the Hausdorff dimension is a unique number in that, if we take some shape in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), and the Hausdorff dimension converges to some number, then the dimension of the shape is given by that number. Otherwise, it will equal \(0\) or \(\infty\). For example, if we want to evaluate the dimension of a square and we use a 1-Dimensional shape as the cover set to calculate the Hausdorff dimension, we will get \(\infty\). On the other hand, if we do the same with a 3-Dimensional shape, we will get 0. And finally if we use a 2-Dimensional shape, the Hausdorff dimension will evaluate to 2. This same notion is important when computing the dimension of a more complex shape such as the Koch snowflake.

To define a fractal, we must define it's dimension. Whilst some research states that a fractal has a non-integer dimension, this is not true for all fractals. Although, most fractals like the Koch snowflake do in fact have non-integer dimensions, we can easily find a counter example namely, the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set lies in the same dimension as a square, a 2-Dimensional shape. However, we give recognition to the complexity and roughness of the Mandelbrot set which clearly distiguishes itself from a square. Beneath the Mandelbrot set's complexity are exact replicates of the largest scaled Mandelbrot set, i.e a self similar shape. Furthermore, although the Mandelbrot set has an integer dimension, the self similarity and complexity is what also defines its fractal nature.

\subsection{Fractal Dimension}
\label{sec:org908b3bf}
The concept of a non-integer dimension may at first seem odd, particularly given that the familiar definition from linear algebra (concerned with the number of vectors within a basis for a vector space \cite{larsonElementaryLinearAlgebra1991}) is strictly an integer value, but in the early \(20^{\mathrm{th}}\) century mathematicians recognised the shortcomings of this definition \cite[Ch. 3]{mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982}.

In this section we hope to convince the reader that there is grounds for
extending the definition of dimension and as a matter of fact many definitions
for non-integer dimensions of a shape have been proposed (see generally
\cite[Ch. 39]{mandelbrotFractalGeometryNature1982} and
\cite[\S 1.3]{gouyetPhysicsFractalStructures1996}) of these the \emph{Hausdorff Dimension} (and corresponding \emph{Hausdorff Measure}) is
considered to be the most important and mathematically robust
\cite[p. 27]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b}, while the box counting
dimension has the most practical applications in science
\cite[p. 192]{peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004}.

The Hausdorff dimension is more like counting balls than boxes and is identical
to the Hausdorff dimension in many cases, it's more general but harder to define
\cite{sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017}, An extension to the work of this report
would be to show the mathematical connections between the Hausdorff Dimension
and box counting dimension with respect to the fractals generated and measured.


\subsubsection{Topological Equivalence}
\label{topological-equivalence}
Topology is an area of mathematics concerned with ideas of continuity through the study of figures that are preserved under homeomorphic transformations \cite{gilmoreTopologyChaosAlice2002} , where two figures are said to be homeomorphic if there is a continuous bijective mapping between the two shapes \cite[p. 105]{peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004}
.
\footnote{For further reading on this topic see \cite[p. 106]{peitgenChaosFractalsNew2004}}

So for example deforming a cube into a sphere would be homeomorphic, but deforming a sphere into a torus would not, because the the surface of the shape would have to be compromised to acheive that.

As mentioned above, historically, the concept of dimension was a difficult problem with a tenuous
definition.  Although an inutitive definition related the dimension of a shape to
the number of parameters needed to describe that shape, this definition is not
sufficient to be preserved under a homeomorphic transform.

Consider the koch fractal and snowflake in figures \ref{koch-line} and \ref{koch-snowflake}, at each iteration the perimeter is given by \(p_{n}= \left(\frac{4}{3} \right)p_{n-1}\) and the number of edges by:



\begin{align}
N_{n} &= N_{n-1} \cdot 4 \\
&= 3 \cdot 4^{n}
\end{align}

If the length of any individual side was given by \(l\) and scaled by some value \(s\) then the length of each individual edge would be given by:

\begin{align}
l = \frac{s \cdot l_{0}}{3^{n}}
\end{align}

The total perimeter would be given by:

\begin{align}
p_{n} &= N_{n} \times l \\
&= 3\cdot 4^{n} \times \frac{s \cdot l_{o}}{3^{n}} \\
&= 3 \cdot s \cdot  l_{0} \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^{n}\\
 \implies p_{n} \cdot s & \propto \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{n}\\
& \implies  n = \frac{\log\left( 4 \right)}{\log\left( 3 \right)} \approx 1.26
\end{align}

This means that if the koch snowflake is scaled by any factor, the resulting perimeter of the snowflake will not be linearly proportional to the scaling factor, as would be the case with an ordinary shape such as a square or a circle, it will instead by proportional to 1.26, this should hopefully motivate the need to more clearly define both the concept of measure (in this case the permiter \footnote{Grant Sanderson equates the measure of a fractal as analogous to mass, which is a very helpful way comparison \cite{sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017}}) and dimension.

To clarify the koch snowflake, is defined such that there are no edges, every point on the ``curve'' is the vertex of an equilateral triangle, this shape has no smooth edges.

See \cite[p. 414]{strogatzNonlinearDynamicsChaos2015} and \cite[\S 5.4]{baderSpacefillingCurvesIntroduction2013} for further reading on the self similar dimension of the \emph{Koch Snowflake}.

This approach of considering the scaling factor of a deterministic fractal is known as the similarity dimension
\cite[p. 413]{strogatzNonlinearDynamicsChaos2015} and should be equal to the
Hausdorff and box counting dimensions for most fractals. For fractals that aren't so obviously self similar it won't be feasible however, \cite[p. 393]{liIntegrationFuzzyLogic2006}  for example with the julia set or the fractal or a coastline it is not immediately clear if the the dimension would be constant at all scales \footnote{It is indeed shown to be mostly constant at all scales in section \S
\ref{linear-reg-julia}}.

\end{wrapfigure}


The Hausdorff dimension depends first on a rigorous definition of measure, this is distinct from the box counting approach in that it is more mathematically rigorous, it is however complex and in practice this report will be concerned with implementing the box counting dimension. \footnote{See \S \ref{haus-resource} for further reading.}

Let \(F\) be some arbitrary subset of euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\), \footnote{A subset of euclidean space could be interpreted as an uncountable set containing all points describing that region}

Let \(U\) be a subset of euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) such that the diamater is defined as the greatest distance between any of the points:

\[
\left\lvert U \right\rvert = \mathrm{sup}\left(\left\{ \left\lvert x- y \right\rvert \enspace : \enspace x,y \in U\right\}  \right)
\]

Consider a collection of these sets, \(G = \left\{U_i: i \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\right\}\) such that each element has a diameter less than \(\delta\).

The motivating idea is that if the elements of \(G\) can be laid ontop of
\(F\) then \(G\) is said to be a \(\delta\) -cover of \(F\), more rigorously, \(G\) is a \(\delta\)-cover of \(F\) if: \footnote{Falconer defines this as \(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}\) \cite[\S 2.1]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b},
presumably treating any index value greater than the cardinality of the set as \(\emptyset\), this is particularly ambiguous and we have avoided it, an alternative way to present that might be \(\bigcup^{\#G}_{i=0}\) where \(\#G\) denotes the cardinality or \(G\) (or \(\infty\) if it is uncountable). The use of \(\#\square\) to denote cardinality was introduced by Knuth in \emph{Concrete Mathematics} \cite{grahamConcreteMathematicsFoundation1994} and is convenenient in that it avoids any ambiguity  with diamater (\(\left\lvert \square \right\rvert\)).}

\begin{align}
    F \subset \bigcup_{U\in B} \left( U \right) \quad :\quad 0 \leq \left\lvert U \right\rvert \leq \delta \label{eq:hausdorff-covering}
\end{align}

An example of this covering is provided in figure \ref{hausdorff-covering}, in that example the figure on the right is covered by squares, which each could be an element of \(\{U_{i}\}\), it is important to note, by this definition, that the shapes represented by \(U\) could be any arbitrary figure \cite[\S 2.1]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b} the size of which may vary in size so long as the diameter is less than \(\delta\).


So for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(F\) could be some arbitrary 2D shape, and \(U_{i}\) could be
a collection of identical squares, OR

\item \(F\) could be the outline of a coastline and \(U_{i}\) could be a set of circles, OR

\item \(F\) could be the surface of a sheet and \(U_{i}\) could be a set of spherical balls as shown in figure \ref{fig:ball-covering}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some authors suggest that the Haussdorff Measure is concerned primarily with round covering objects (see e.g. \cite{sandersonFractalsAreTypically2017}), this is well illustrated by figure \ref{fig:ball-covering}, however in truth it is merely more convenient to use round shapes for most fractals.

\item The use of balls is a simpler but equivalent approach to the theory \cite[\textsection 2.4 ]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b} because any set of diamater \(r\) can be enclosed in a ball of radius \(\frac{r}{2}\) \cite[p. 166]{edgarMeasureTopologyFractal2008}
\end{itemize}

\item \(F\) could be a more abstracted figure like figures \ref{hausdorff-covering} or \ref{abstract-shape}  and \(\{U_{i}\}\) a collection of various different lines, shapes or 3d objects.
\end{itemize}

The Hausdorff measure is concerned with only the diamater of each element of \(\{U_{i}\}\) and considers \(\sum_{U \in G} \left[\left\lvert U\right\rvert^{s}\right]\) where each element \(U\in G\) is arranged so as to minimize the value of the summation \cite[p. 27]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b}
, the \(\delta\)-Hausdorff is hence defined, for various dimensions \(s\):

\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}^s_{\delta}\left( F \right)= \inf \left\{ \sum_{U\in G}   \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \enspace : \enspace  \left\{U_i\right\} \text{ is a } \delta \text{-cover of } F \right\}, \quad \delta, s > 0 \label{eq:delta-measure}
\end{align}

The value of \(s\) can be different regardless of the dimension of \(F\), for example if \(F\) was an arbitrary 2D shape the value of \(\mathcal{H}_{\delta}^{2}\left(F\right)\)
is equivalent to considering the number of shapes \(U\in G\) (e.g. boxes, discs etc.), of
diamater \(\leq \delta\) that will cover over a shape as shown in figure
\ref{hausdorff-covering}, the delta Haussendorf measure
\(\mathcal{H}^{2}_{\delta} \left(F\right)\) will be the area of the boxes when
arranged in such a way that minimises the area.

As \(\delta\) is made arbitrarily small \(\matcal{H}_{\delta}^{s}\) will approach some limit, in the case of figures \ref{hausdorff-covering}  and \ref{abstract-shape} the value of \(\mathcal{H}^{2}_{\delta}\) will approach the area of the shape as \(\delta \rightarrow 0\) and so the \(s^{th}\) dimensional Hausdorff measure is given by:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}^{s} = \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left( \mathcal{H}^{s}_{\delta} \right) \label{eq:limit-haus}
\end{align}

This is defined for all subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) for example the value of  \(\mathcal{H}^{2}\) corresponding to figure \ref{abstract-shape} will be limit that boxes would approach when covering that area, which would be the area of the shape (\(4\times 1^2 + 4\times \pi\times \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2}\times 1 \times \sin{\frac{\pi}{3}}\)).





\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includesvg[width=5cm]{notes/HaussDorf_Dim_Ink}
\caption{\label{hausdorff-covering}The blue outline corresponds to some \(F \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}\), covered by various grey objects, each of which represent an element from the set \(U_{i}\). The grey shapes all have a diameter less than \(\delta\) and so this  \(\bigcup \left[U_{i}\right]\) would be a \(\delta\)-covering of \(F\).}
\end{wrapfigure}




\paragraph{Lower Dimension Hausdorff Measurements}
\label{sec:org1c0769e}
\subparagraph{Examples}
\label{sec:org5af3a1a}
Consider again the example of a 2D shape, the value of \(\mathcal{H}^{1}\) would still be defined by \eqref{eq:delta-measure}, but unlike \(\mathcal{H}^{2}\) in \S \ref{hausdorff-measure} the value of \(\left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^1\) would be considered as opposed to \(\left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^2\) (i.e. the diamater as opposed to the diameter squared).

As \(\delta\) is made arbitrarily small the boxes \footnote{Even though \(U\) may contain a variety of shapes, \eqref{eq:delta-measure} is concerned only with the power of there diameter, so in this sense the limit is concerned only with boxes corresponding to the diameter of the elements of \(U\)} that cover the shape are made also to be arbitrarily small. Although the area of the boxes must clearly be bounded by the shape of \(F\), if one imagines an infinite number of infinitely dense lines packing into a 2D shape with an infinite density it can be seen that the total length of those lines will be infinite and so the limit in \eqref{eq:limit-haus} will increase without bound.

To build on that same analogy, another way to imagine this is to pack a 2D shape with straight lines, the total length of all lines will approach the same value as the length of the lines of the squares as they are packed infinitely densely. Because lines cannot fill a 2D shape, as the density of the lines increases, the overall length will increase without bound.

This is consistent with factals as well, consider the koch snowflake introduced in section \ref{topological-equivalence} and shown in figure \ref{koch-line}, the dimension of this shape, as shown in \S \ref{topological-equivalence} is greater than 1, and the number of lines necessary to describe that shape is also infinite because every point of the ``curve'' is a point of an equilateral triangle.

\subparagraph{Formally}
\label{sec:org4045c90}
If the dimension of \(F\) is less than \(s\), the Hausdorff Measure will be given by:

\begin{align}
\mathrm{dim}\left(  F \right ) < s \implies \mathcal{H}^{s} \left( F \right)  = \infty
\end{align}

\paragraph{Higher Dimension Hausdorff Dimension}
\label{sec:orgdac73d6}


For small values of \(s\) (i.e. less than the dimension of  \(F\)), the value of \(\mathcal{H}^s\)  will be \(\infty\).

Consider some value \(s\) such that the Hausdorff measure is not infinite, i.e. values of \(s\):

\[
\mathcal{H}^s = L \in \mathbb{R}
\]

Consider a dimensional value \(t\) that is larger than  \(s\) and observe that:

\begin{align*}
0<s<t  \implies   \sum_{i}  \left[ \left\levert U_i \right\rvert^t \right] &= \sum_{i}\left[ \left\levert U_i \right\rvert^{t- s} \cdot  \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right] \\
&\leq \sum_{i} \left[ \delta^{t - s} \cdot \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s  \right]    \\
&= \delta^{t- s}\sum_{i}   \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right] 									   \\
\end{align*}

Now if \(\lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left[ \sum_{i}   \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right]\) is defined as a non-infinite value:

\begin{align}
    \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0} \left( \sum_{i}   \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^t \right]  \right) & \leq \lim_{\delta}\left( \delta^{t- s} \sum_{i}   \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right]  \right) \\
&\leq \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left( \delta^{t - s} \right) \cdot  \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\left( \sum_{i} \left[ \left\lvert U_i \right\rvert^s \right]    \right) \\
&\leq 0
\end{align}

and so we have the following relationship:

\begin{align}
    \mathcal{H}^{s} \left(F\right) \in \mathbb{R}^{+}  \implies  \mathcal{H}^t\left( F \right)= 0 \quad \forall t > s \label{eq:hdfzero}
\end{align}

Hence the value of the s-dimensional \emph{Hausdorff Measure}, \(s\) is only a finite, non-zero value, when \(s = \mathrm{dim}_{H}\left( F \right)\).

\caption{\label{abstract-shape}A disconnected subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\), the squares have a diameter of \(\sqrt{2}\), the circles 1 and the equilateral triangles 1.}
\end{wrapfigure}


The value \(s\) at which \(\mathcal{H}^{s}\) \eqref{eq:hdfzero} changes from \(\infty\) to 0, shown in figure \ref{hausdorff-vals},  is the defined to be the \emph{Hausdorff Dimension} \cite[\S 2.2]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b}, it is a generalisation of the idea of dimension that is typically understood with respect to ordinary figures.

\subsubsection{Box Counting Dimension}
\label{sec:org2704751}
While the Hasudorff dimension is the first formal definition to measure
the roughness of a fractal, there are several other definitions of dimension
that have stemmed from this. Namely, the box-counting dimension. The box
counting method is widely used as it is relatively easy to calculate \cite[p. 41]{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003b}
and in many cases is equal to the \emph{Hausdorff Dimension}  \cite[p. 11]{markpollicottFractalsDimensionTheory2005} (see generally \cite{ListFractalsHausdorff2020}).
The box-counting dimension is defined as the following from
\cite{falconerFractalGeometryMathematical2003}:

Let \(F\) be any non-empty bounded subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and let \(N_\delta(F)\) be the smallest
number of sets of diameter at most \(\delta\) which can cover \(F\). The \emph{lower} and \emph{upper}
box-counting dimensions of \(F\) respectively are defined as

\begin{equation*}
    \underline{\text{dim}}_BF = \underline{\lim}_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\ln N_\delta(F)}{-\ln \delta}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\overline{\text{dim}}_BF = \overline{\lim}_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\ln N_\delta(F)}{-\ln \delta}
\end{equation*}

When the \emph{lower} and \emph{upper} box-counting dimensions of \(F\) are equal, then

\begin{equation*}
\text{dim}_BF = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\ln N_\delta(F)}{-\ln \delta}
\end{equation*}

For example, suppose we had a square with side length 1 and we use smaller squares of side
length \(\frac{1}{\delta}\) to cover the larger square. This would mean that one side of the
large square would need \(\delta\) \(\frac{1}{\delta}\) small squares, and so to cover
the entire square, one would need \(n^2\) small squares, i.e. \(N_{\frac{1}{n}}(F) = n^2\). Now,
substituting these values into the box-counting definiton, we get:

\begin{align*}
\text{dim}_BF &= \lim_{\frac{1}{\delta} \to 0} \frac{\ln(\delta^2)}{-\ln(\frac{1}{\delta})}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{\delta} \to 0} \frac{\ln(\delta^2)}{\ln(\delta)}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{\delta} \to 0} 2\frac{\ln(\delta)}{\ln(\delta)}\\
&= 2
\end{align*}

Which is expected, becuase we know that a square is a 2-Dimensional shape. We
can apply this same concept to fractals. Consider another example, the Koch
Curve, a self similar fractal which we can calculate its dimension and provide a
measure of roughness of the curve. If we take a close look at the curve progression
in figure \ref{koch-line}, the pattern begins with one line segment and the middle third
of the line is replaced with two sides of an equilateral triangle with side length
\(\frac{1}{3}\). After this first iteration, the line segment now becomes four line
segments. Thus, if we use a square of length \(\frac{1}{3^{\delta}}\) to cover the \(\delta^{th}\)
iteration of the curve, there will be \(4^{\delta}\) line segments covered.

Let \(F\) be the Koch Curve.
\begin{align*}
\text{dim}_BF &= \lim_{\frac{1}{3^{\delta}} \to 0} \frac{\ln(4^{\delta})}{-\ln(\frac{1}{3^{\delta}})}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{3^{\delta}} \to 0} \frac{\ln(4^{\delta})}{\ln(3^{\delta})}\\
&= \lim_{\frac{1}{3^{\delta}} \to 0} \frac{\ln(4)}{\ln(3)}\\
&= \frac{\ln(4)}{\ln(3)}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Generating Self Similar Fractals}
\label{sec:orgea71caf}
In order to investigate the dimension of fractals, we intend to generate and measure a variety of figures by using of \textbf{\emph{R}} \cite{rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020}, \emph{Julia} \cite{bezansonJuliaFreshApproach2017} and \emph{Python} \cite{WelcomePythonOrg}.

Self Similar fractals have a self-similar dimension and so can be used to verify an approach implemented with a programming language.

\subsubsection{Vicsek Fractal}
\label{vicsek-fractal}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{media/Vicsek-Fractal.png}
\caption{\label{vicsek-fractal-julia}Vicsek fractal \cite[p. 12]{vicsekFractalGrowthPhenomena1992} (also known as the \emph{AntiCross-Stictch} \cite{janwassenaarCantorDust2005}) produced by listing \ref{vicsek-matrix-gen}, at each iterative step the fractal itself is ``copied'' to the four corners of itself producing this complex shape.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The Vicsek Fractal \cite[p. 12]{vicsekFractalGrowthPhenomena1992} involves a pattern of iterating boxes, to implement this consider the process\footnote{This was actually a fractal I came up with myself only to later find that somebody already had the same idea!}:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{B} \leftarrow
   \begin{bmatrix}
       \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} \\
       \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} \\
       \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} \\
   \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:visek-iter}
\end{align}

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\mathbf{B}= \left[ 1 \right]\)
\item \(\mathbf{Z}= \left[ 0 \right]\)
\end{itemize}



If this is repeated many times a matrix of values will be created, such a matrix
can be interpreted as a greyscale image and plotted as a heatmap to show the
fractal (shown in figure ).

The iterative process shown in \eqref{eq:visek-iter} is represented as a recursive function at line 5 of listing \ref{vicsek-matrix-gen} and plotted immediately after. To measure the the dimension of this fractal a the sum of the matrix is taken to be the measure of the fractal, two fractals are generated and the change in size relative to the scale is compared and the log taken to return the value of the dimension:

\[
\mathcal{D} = \frac{s}{m_{2}/m_{1}}
\]

The recursive function begins with a 3x3 matrix, where the four corner squares
and middle square are set to 1 and the rest are set to 0, a new matrix is built
by joining together the past matrix following the rule described in \eqref{eq:visek-iter}.
The function repeats until it reaches some arbitrary set width.

At each step of the process, the number of elements of this fractal increases by
a ratio of 5 while the height increases only by a factor of 3, hence the self
similarity dimension is given by:


\begin{align}
5 &= 3^{\mathcal{D}} \nonumber \\
\implies \mathcal{D} &= \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 3} \label{eq:vic-dim-val}
\end{align}

By modifying listing \ref{vicsek-matrix-gen} alternative fractals can get also be generated like \emph{Cantor's Dust} and \emph{Sierpinski's Carpet} shown in figures \ref{fig:cantor-dust} and .

Upon review this is actually a variant on the \emph{Cantor Dust} which should
actually be represented by a \(3 \times 3\) matrix:

\begin{align}

    \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{Z} \\
    \mathbf{B} & \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{B} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}


and hence has the same dimension as the \emph{Vicsek Fractal} as opposed to a
dimension of 1.

\paragraph{Sierpinski's Triangle}
\label{sec:orgd36c1c0}
Not all fractal patterns can be produced by using recursive functions involving matrices, one such function is \emph{Sierpinskis Triangle}.
\subparagraph{Chaos Game}
\label{sec:org9187353}
The chaos game is a technique that can generate fractals, one of the advantages of this approach is that it can provide an estimate of the theoretical measure of a fractal without needing to iterate a function many times. The technique involves marking 3 points of an equilateral triangle and marking an arbitrary point, select one of these 3 points randomly with a uniform probability and create a new point halfway between the previous point and this point, repeat this process for as many points of detail are desired for the image.

This can be visualised by mapping the co-ordinates of an equilateral triangle to a cartesian plane:

\begin{description}
\item[{\(A\)}] \(\left(0, 0\right)\)
\item[{\(B\)}] \(\left(0, 1\right)\)
\item[{\(A\)}] \(\left(0.5, \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)\)
\end{description}

The mean value of the \(x\), \(y\) values for these co-ordinates is equal to the
halfway point and using this the chaos game can be implemented as a program and
visualised by plotting each point on a scatter plot. This is implemented in
\emph{\textbf{R}} in listing \ref{l-sier-tri} and the output is shown in figure \ref{fig:s-tri}.

To measure the fractal dimension of this could be done by mapping the cartesian
plane back to a matrix and taking the same approach as previous fractals
presented, this however was not implemented, due to time constraints, the
dimension was however measured using the method discussed at \S \ref{pas-tri}.

\subparagraph{Pascals Triange}

The even and odd values in \emph{Pascal's Triangle} demonstrate the same pattern as
the \emph{Sierpinski Triangle} this is discussed in greater detail in \S
\ref{pascal-sierpinski}, implementing this to produce the sierpinski triangle is very
simple, it is however significantly more resource intensive, even in \emph{Julia}
than using the chaos game and the the measured dimension converges to the self
similar dimension very slowly.

The fractal produced is composed of right angle triangles, as opposed to equilateral triangles but interestingly the measured dimension is still the same as an equlateral \emph{Sierpinski's Triangle}, it does however converge to this value slowly.

\subsubsection{Turtle}
\label{sec:orgd3c47c1}
Some Fractals cannot be well explained by using matrices or the chaos game, Turtle graphics are a programatic way to draw a pen across a screen, these are implemented in \emph{Julia} using the \emph{Luxor} package \cite{JuliaGraphicsLuxorJl2020}.

We were unfourtunately unable to implement a strategy to measure the dimension
of such fractals, one such approach that looked promising but did not return
consistent results was to export the generated image to a PNG and then import
that file as a matrix using the \emph{Python Pillow Library} \cite{PillowPillowPIL} or
the \emph{Julia Images} library \cite{JuliaImagesImagesJl2020}, when this was
unsucessful we also experimented with \emph{ImageMagick} \cite{llcImageMagick},
\emph{AstroPy} \cite{Astropy} and \emph{JuliaAstro} \cite{JuliaAstroJuliaAstro}.
Unfourtunately the values returned by this approach were inconsistent and
further investigation into this method is required.

\subsubsection{Pascals Triangle and Sierpinski's Triangle}
\label{pascal-sierpinski}
\paragraph{Motivation}
\label{sec:org78d1c7f}
Over many centuries, mathematicians have been able to produce a range of patterns from Pascal's triangle. One of which is relevant to the emergence of Sierpinski's triangle. To construct Pascal's triangle it begins with a 1 in the \(0^{th}\) (top) row, then each row underneath is made up of the sum of the numbers directly above it, see figure \ref{fig:pascal-triangle}. Alternatively, the \(n^{th}\) row and \(k^{th}\) column can be written in combinatorics form, \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}\).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{media/tikz/pascals-triangle.png}
\caption{\label{fig:pascal-triangle}Pascal's triangle}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{The connection}
\label{sec:org95c6d3d}
As mentioned before there is one pattern that produces the Sierpinski triangle, namely highlighting all odd numbers in Pascal's triangle. This is equivalent to considering all the numbers in the triangle modulo 2, shown in figure \ref{fig:pascal-sierpinski-tri}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{media/tikz/pascal-sierpinski-tri.png}
\label{fig:pascal-sierpinski-tri}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{media/tikz/row-column-pascal.png}
\caption{\label{fig:row-column-pascal}The black squares represent one example of a position on Pascal's triangle that are equivalent modulo 2}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:pascal-sierpinski-tri}, we can observe that all the highlighted odd numbers begin to form the Sierpinski triangle. Note that this is not the complete Sierpinski's triangle, that would require an infinite number of iterations. Now, we also notice that there are three identical Sierpinski triangles within the larger triangle, each containing the same value modulo 2, at each corresponding row and column.

To prove this, we need to split the triangle into two parts, \(P_{n}\) denoting the first \(2^{n}\) rows, i.e. the top ``Sierpinski triangle'' in figure \ref{fig:pascal-sierpinski-tri} and \(P_{n+1}\) representing the entire triangle. We must show that any chosen square in \(P_{n}\) is equal to the corresponding row and column in the lower two triangles of \(P_{n+1}\), shown in figure \ref{fig:row-column-pascal}. This requires an identity that allows us to work with combinations in modulo 2, namely Lucas' Theorem.

\textbf{Lucas' Theorem}
Let \(n,k \ge 0\) and for some prime \(p\), we get:
\begin{equation}
\binom{n}{k} = \prod_{i=0}^{m} \binom{n_i}{k_i} \quad (\text{mod}~p)
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align*}
n &= n_{m}p^{m}+n_{m-1}p^{m-1}+\cdots + n_{1}p+n_{0},\\
k &= k_{m}p^{m}+k_{m-1}p^{m-1}+\cdots + k_{1}p+k_{0}\\
\end{align*}
are the expansions in radix \(p\) \footnote{Radix refers to a numerical system which uses some number of digits. Since we are working in modulo 2 for Pascal's triangle, we are only concerned with the numbers \(0\) or \(1\), i.e. a radix 2 or a binary numeric system.}. This uses the convention that \(\binom{n}{k} = 0\) if \(k < n\)

Take some arbitrary row \(r\) and column \(c\) in the triangle \(P_{n}\). If we add \(2^{n}\) rows to \(r\), we will reach the equivalent row and column in the lower left triangle of \(P_{n+1}\), since there are \(2^{n}\) rows in \(P_{n}\). In the same way, if we add \(2^{n}\) columns to \(c\) we reach the equivalent row and column in the lower right triangle of \(P_{n+1}\), leaving us with:

\begin{align*}
\text{Top Triangle:} \quad &\binom{r}{c} \label{eq:top} \\
\text{Bottom-left Triangle:}\quad &\binom{r + 2^n}{c} \label{eq:bottom-left} \\
\text{Bottom-right Triangle :}\quad &\binom{r + 2^n}{c + 2^n} \label{eq:bottom-right}
\end{align*}

Using Lucas' theorem, we can prove that the above statments are equivalent.

We can rewrite \(r\) and \(c\) in base 2 notation as follows:
\begin{align*}
r=r_{i}2^{i}+r_{i-1}2^{i-1}+\cdots + r_{1}2+r_{0}= \left[r_{i}r_{i-1}\cdots r_{1}r_{0}\right]_2\\
c=c_{i}2^{i}+c_{i-1}2^{i-1}+\cdots +c_{1}2+c_{0}=\left[c_{i}c_{i-1}\cdots c_{1}c_{0}\right]_2\\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\binom{2^n + r}{c}~(\text{mod}~2) &= \binom{1r_{i-1}r_{i-2} \cdots r_{0}}{0c_{i-1}c_{i-2} \cdots c_{0}} \quad (\text{mod} 2)\\
&= \binom{1}{0}\binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad (\text{mod} 2)\\
&=\binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad (\text{mod} 2)\\
&= \binom{r}{c} \quad (\text{mod} 2)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\binom{2^n + r}{2^n + c}~(\text{mod}~2) &= \binom{1r_{i-1}r_{i-2} \cdots r_{0}}{1c_{i-1}c_{i-2} \cdots c_{0}} \quad (\text{mod} 2)\\
&= \binom{1}{1}\binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad (\text{mod} 2)\\
&=\binom{r_{i-1}}{c_{i-1}}\binom{r_{i-2}}{c_{i-2}} \cdots \binom{r_0}{c_0} \quad (\text{mod} 2)\\
&= \binom{r}{c} \quad (\text{mod} 2)
\end{align*}

Thus, \(\binom{r}{c} = \binom{2^n + r}{c} = \binom{2^n + r}{2^n + c} \quad (\text{mod} 2)\), which concludes the proof

\subsubsection{Calculating the Dimension of Julia Set}
\label{sec:orge71316c}
It converges too slowly
The Julia set (discussed in section ) can be solved by \ldots{}

explain the code a little bit here

as shown in listing

A value on the complex plane can be associated with the julia set by iterating
that value against a function of the form \(z \rightarrow z^{2} + \alpha + i
\beta\) and measureing whether or not that value diverges or converges. This process is demonstrated in listing \ref{jsetDivFunc}.

By associating each value on the complex plane with an element of a matrix an image of this pattern may be produced, see for example figure RABBIT

\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{julia}
#!/bin/julia
function juliaSet(z, num, my_func, boolQ=true)
    count = 1
    # Iterate num times
    while count ≤ num
        # check for divergence
        if real(z)^2+imag(z)^2 > 2^2
            if(boolQ) return 0 else return Int(count) end
        end
        #iterate z
        z = my_func(z) # + z
        count=count+1
    end
        #if z hasn't diverged by the end
    if(boolQ) return 1 else return Int(count) end
end
\end{minted}
\caption{\label{jsetDivFunc}Function that returns how many iterations of a function of is necessary for a complex value to diverge, the julia set is concerned with the function \(z \rightarrow z^{2} + \alpha + i \beta\)}
\end{listing}

$$\begin{aligned}
F_n = F_{n- 1} +  F_{n- 2} ; \quad F_1 = F_2 = 1

\text{Recall that $F_n > 0 \forall n$}\\
&=  1 +  \frac{1}{    \left\lvert G \right\rvert } \\
 \implies  0 &= G^2- G +  1; \quad G > 0  \\
  \implies  G = \varphi &=  \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1  }{2} \quad  \square
\end{aligned}$$


\subsubsection{Comments}
\label{sec:org85e78ac}

The Fibonacci sequence is quite unique, observe that:

This can be rearranged to show that the Fibonacci sequence is itself
when shifted in either direction, it is the sequence that does not
change during recursion.

\[\begin{aligned}
F_{n+ 1} - F_{n} = F_{n- 1} \quad \forall n > 1
\end{aligned}\]

This is analogous to how \(e^x\) doesn't change under differentiation:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}\left( e^x \right) \ldots
\end{aligned}$$

or how 0 is the additive identity and it shows why generating functions
are so useful.

Observe also that

$$\begin{aligned}
\lim_{n     \rightarrow \infty }\left[ \frac{F_n}{F_{n- 1} }  \right] &= \varphi \\
\lim_{n     \rightarrow \infty }\left[ \frac{F_n}{F_{n- 1} }  \right] &= \psi \\
\varphi - \psi &=  1 \\
\varphi \times  \psi  &= 1 \\
\frac{\psi}{\varphi}  = \frac{1}{\varphi^2} = \frac{1}{1-\varphi} &= \frac{1}{2-\varphi} = \frac{2}{3 - \sqrt{5}  }

\cite{shellyallenFibonacciNature,benedettapalazzoNumbersNatureFibonacci2016,MinarovaNikoletta2014TFSN,NatureGoldenRatio2018,robertlambHowAreFibonacci2008,ronknottFibonacciNumbersGolden2016}), an example of such an occurence is discussed in section \ref{sunflower-example}.


In this section we lay out a strategy to find an analytic solution to the
\emph{Fibonacci Sequence} by relating it to a continuous series and generalise this
approach to any homogenous linear recurrence relation.

This details some open mathematical work for the project and our hope is that by
identifying relationships between discrete and continuous systems generall we
will be able to draw insights with regard to the occurrence of patterns related
to the \emph{Fibonacci Sequence} and \emph{Golden Ratio} in nature.

\subsection{Computational Approach}
\label{define-the-fibonacci-numbers}
Given that much of our work will involve computational analysis and simulation we begin with a strategy to solve the sequence computationally.

The \emph{Fibonacci} Numbers are given by:

\begin{align}
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \label{eq:fib-def}
\end{align}

This type of recursive relation can be expressed in \emph{Python} by using recursion,
as shown in listing \ref{fib-rec-0}, however using this function will reveal that it
is extraordinarily slow, as shown in listing \ref{time-slow}, this is because the
results of the function are not cached and every time the function is called
every value is recalculated\footnote{Dr. Hazrat mentions something similar in his book with respect to
\emph{Mathematica}\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
\cite[Ch. 13]{hazratMathematicaProblemCenteredApproach2015}}, meaning that the workload scales in
exponential as opposed to polynomial time.

The \texttt{functools} library for python includes the \texttt{@functools.lru\_cache} decorator
which will modify a defined function to cache results in memory
\cite{FunctoolsHigherorderFunctions}, this means that the recursive function will
only need to calculate each result once and it will hence scale in polynomial
time, this is implemented in listing \ref{fib-cache}.


\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{python}
  def rec_fib(k):
      if type(k) is not int:
          print("Error: Require integer values")

          return 0

\end{minted}

Restructuring the problem to use iteration will allow for even greater performance as demonstrated by finding \(F_{10^{6}}\) in listing \ref{fib-iter}. Using a compiled language such as \emph{Julia} however would be thousands of times faster still, as demonstrated in listing \ref{julia-fib}.



\begin{listing}[htbp]
\begin{minted}[]{python}
  def my_it_fib(k):
      if k == 0:
          return k
      elif type(k) is not int:

          return 0

In this case however an analytic solution can be found by relating discrete
mathematical problems to continuous ones as discussed below at section .
\subsection{Exponential Generating Functions}
\label{exp-gen-func-fib-seq}
\paragraph{Motivation}
\label{motivation}
Consider the \emph{Fibonacci Sequence} from \eqref{eq:fib-def}:


\begin\{aLign
    a\textsubscript{n}\&= a\textsubscript{n - 1} + a\textsubscript{n - 2} \nonumber \\
\iff a\textsubscript{n+  2} \&= a\textsubscript{n+  1} +  a\textsubscript{n} \label{eq:fib-def-shift}
\end{align}


from observation, this appears similar in structure to the following \emph{ordinary
differential equation}, which would be fairly easy to deal with:


\begin{align*}
f''\left( x \right)- f'\left( x \right)- f\left( x \right)=  0
\end{align*}

By ODE Theory we have \(y \propto e^{m_{i}x}, \enspace i = 1, 2\):

\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)= e^{mx} = \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ r^{m} \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]
\end{align*}

So using some sort of a transformation involving a power series may help to
relate the discrete problem back to a continuous one.

\paragraph{Example}
\label{solving-the-sequence}
Consider using the following generating function, (proof of the
generating function derivative as in \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-2} and \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-3} is
provided in section \ref{Derivative-exp-gen-function})




\begin{align}
    f\left( x \right) &=  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_{n} \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]   \label{eq:exp-gen-def-1} \\
 \implies   f'\left( x \right) &=  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_{n+1} \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]   \label{eq:exp-gen-def-2} \\
\implies    f''\left( x \right) &=  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_{n+2} \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]   \label{eq:exp-gen-def-3}
\end{align}


So the Fibonacci recursive relation from \eqref{eq:fib-def-shift}  could be expressed :


\begin{align*}
a_{n+  2}    &= a_{n+  1} +  a_{n}\\
\frac{x^n}{n!}   a_{n+  2}    &= \frac{x^n}{n!}\left( a_{n+  1} +  a_{n}  \right)\\
\sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} \left[ \frac{x^n}{n!}   a_{n+  2} \right]        &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^n}{n!} a_{n+  1} \right]  + \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^n}{n!} a_{n}  \right]  \\
\end{align*}

And hence by applying \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-1}, \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-2} and \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-3}:

\begin{align}
f''\left( x \right) &= f'\left( x \right)+  f\left( x \right)
\end{align}


Using the theory of higher order linear differential equations with
constant coefficients it can be shown:


\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)= c_1 \cdot  \mathrm{exp}\left[ \left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)x \right] +  c_2 \cdot  \mathrm{exp}\left[ \left( \frac{1 +  \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)x \right]
\end{align*}


By equating this to the power series:


\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \left( c_1\left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n +  c_2  \left( \frac{1+ \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n \right) \cdot  \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]
\end{align*}


Now given that:


\begin{align*}
f\left( x \right)= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]
\end{align*}


We can conclude that:


\begin{align*}
a_n = c_1\cdot  \left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n +  c_2 \cdot  \left( \frac{1+  \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n
\end{align*}


By applying the initial conditions:


\begin{align*}
a_0= c_1 +  c_2  \implies  c_1= - c_2\\
a_1= c_1 \left( \frac{1+ \sqrt{5} }{2} \right) -  c_1 \left( \frac{1-\sqrt{5} }{2} \right)  \implies  c_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} }\\
\therefore ~ c_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}, ~ c_2 = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}}
\end{align*}


And so finally we have the solution to the \emph{Fibonacci Sequence} \ref{eq:fib-def-shift}:


\begin{align}
    a_n &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} } \left[ \left( \frac{1+  \sqrt{5} }{2}  \right)^n -  \left( \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \right)^n \right] \nonumber \\
&= \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5} } \nonumber\\
&=\frac{\varphi^n -  \psi^n}{\varphi - \psi} \label{eq:fib-sol}
\end{align}


where:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\varphi = \frac{1+ \sqrt{5} }{2} \approx 1.61\ldots\)
\item \(\psi = 1-\varphi = \frac{1- \sqrt{5} }{2} \approx 0.61\ldots\)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Derivative of the Exponential Generating Function}
\label{Derivative-exp-gen-function}
\subparagraph{Base}
\label{sec:org856b9a1}
Differentiating the exponential generating function has the effect of shifting the sequence once to the left: \cite{lehmanReadingsMathematicsComputer2010}

\begin{align}
    f\left( x \right) &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} \right] \label{eq:exp-pow-series} \\
f'\left( x \right) &= \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}\left( \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} \right]  \right) \nonumber \\
&= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \left( a_0 \frac{x^0}{0!} +  a_1 \frac{x^1}{1!} +  a_2 \frac{x^2}{2!}+  a_3 \frac{x^3}{3! } +  \ldots \frac{x^k}{k!} \right) \nonumber \\
&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}\left( a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} \right) \right] \nonumber \\
&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ \frac{a_n}{{\left({ n- 1 }\right)!}} } x^{n- 1}  \right]} \nonumber \\
\implies f'(x) &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 1}   {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}a_{n+  1} }\right]} \label{eq:exp-pow-series-sol}
\end{align}

\subparagraph{Bridge}
\label{sec:org20deed6}
This can be shown for all derivatives by way of induction, for

\begin{align}
f^{(k)}\left(x\right) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!} \quad \text{for}~k \ge 0
\end{align}

Assume that \(f^{(k)}\left(x\right) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!}\)

Using this assumption, prove for the next element \(k+1\)

We need \(f^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k+1}\cdot x^n}{n!}\)

\begin{align*}
    \text{LHS} &= f^{(k+1)}(x)\\
    &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(f^{(k)}(x)\right)\\
    &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!}\right)\quad \text{by assumption}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot n\cdot x^{n-1}}{n!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k+1}\cdot x^{n}}{n!}\\
    &= \text{RHS}
\end{align*}

Therefore, by mathematical induction \(f^{(k)}\left(x\right) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty\frac{a_{n+k}\cdot x^n}{n!} \quad \text{for}~k \ge 0\)

Furthermore, if the first derivative of the exponential generating function shown in \eqref{eq:exp-pow-series-sol}
shifts the sequence across, then every derivative thereafter does so as well.

\paragraph{Homogeneous Proof}
\label{sec:org9943528}
An equation of the form:

\begin{align}
\sum^{n}_{i=0} \left[ c_{i} \cdot f^{(i)}(x) \right] = 0 \label{eq:hom-ode}
\end{align}

is said to be a homogenous linear ODE: \cite[Ch. 2]{zillDifferentialEquations2009a}

\begin{description}
\item[{Linear}] because the equation is linear with respect to \(f(x)\)
\item[{Ordinary}] because there are no partial derivatives (e.g. \(\frac{\partial }{\partial x}{\left({ f{\left({ x }\right)} }\right)}\)  )
\item[{Differential}] because the derivates of the function are concerned
\item[{Homogenous}] because the \textbf{\emph{RHS}} is 0
\begin{itemize}
\item A non-homogeous equation would have a non-zero RHS
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

There will be \(k\) solutions to a \(k^{\mathrm{th}}\) order linear ODE, each may be summed to produce a superposition which will also be a solution to the equation, \cite[Ch. 4]{zillDifferentialEquations2009a}  this will be considered as the desired complete solution (and this will be shown to be the only solution for the recurrence relation \eqref{eq:recurrence-relation-def}. These \(k\) solutions will be in one of two forms:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \(f(x)=c_{i} \cdot e^{m_{i}x}\)
\item \(f(x)=c_{i} \cdot x^{j}\cdot e^{m_{i}x}\)
\end{enumerate}

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\sum^{k}_{i=0}\left[  c_{i}m^{k-i} \right] = 0\)
\begin{itemize}
\item This is referred to the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation or ODE \cite{levinSolvingRecurrenceRelations2018}
\end{itemize}
\item \(\exists i,j \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \cap \left[0,k\right]\)
\begin{itemize}
\item These are often referred to as repeated roots \cite{levinSolvingRecurrenceRelations2018,zillMatrixExponential2009} with a multiplicity corresponding to the number of repetitions of that root \cite[\textsection 3.2]{nicodemiIntroductionAbstractAlgebra2007}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Unique Roots of Characteristic Equation}
\label{uniq-roots-recurrence}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Example
\label{sec:org8a2e752}
An example of a recurrence relation with all unique roots is the fibonacci sequence, as described in section \ref{solving-the-sequence}.
\item Proof
\label{sec:org0f20aca}
Consider the linear recurrence relation \eqref{eq:recurrence-relation-def}:

\begin{align}
\sum^{n}_{i= 0}   \left[ c_i \cdot  a_i \right] = 0, \quad \exists c \in
\mathbb{R}, \enspace \forall i<k\in\mathbb{Z}^+ \nonumber \label{eq:recurrence-relation-def}
\end{align}
This implies:


\begin{align}
    \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \left[ \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   \left[ \frac{x^n}{n!} c_i a_n \right]  \right]  &= 0 \\
    \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}    \sum^{k}_{i= 0}    \frac{x^n}{n!} c_i a_n    &= 0 \\
        \sum^{k}_{i= 0} c_i \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}    \frac{x^n}{n!}  a_n    &= 0
\end{align}

By implementing the exponential generating function as shown in
\eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-1}, this provides:

\begin{align}
   \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   \left[ c_i f^{\left( i \right)}\left( x \right) \right]
\end{align}


Now assume that the solution exists and all roots of the characteristic polynomial are unique (i.e. the solution is of the form \(f{\left({ x }\right)} \propto e^{m_i x}: \quad m_i \neq m_j \forall i\neq j\)), this implies that  \cite[Ch. 4]{zillDifferentialEquations2009a} :

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)} = \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ k_i e^{m_i x} }\right]}, \quad \exists m,k \in \mathbb{C} \nonumber
\end{align}

This can be re-expressed in terms of the exponential power series, in order to relate the solution of the function \(f{\left({ x }\right)}\) back to a solution of the sequence \(a_n\), (see section for a derivation of the exponential power series \textbf{\#TODO make section on to prove exponential power series using taylor series expansion if we get time)}:

\begin{align}
    \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ k_i e^{m_i x}  }\right]}  &= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ k_i \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \frac{{\left({ m_i x }\right)}^n}{n!}  }\right]}  \nonumber \\
							 &= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   k_i m_i^n \frac{x^n}{n!} \nonumber\\
							 &=    \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   k_i m_i^n \frac{x^n}{n!} \nonumber \\
							 &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}  \sum^{k}_{i=0}   {\left[{ k_im^n_i }\right]}  }\right]}, \quad \exists k_i \in \mathbb{C}, \enspace \forall i \in \mathbb{Z}^+\cap {\left[{ 1, k }\right]}     \label{eq:unique-root-sol-power-series-form}
\end{align}


Recall the definition of the generating function from \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-1}, by equating this to \eqref{eq:unique-root-sol-power-series-form}:

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)} &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{  \frac{x^n}{n!} a_n }\right]} \nonumber \\
&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}  \sum^{k}_{i=0}   {\left[{ k_im^n_i }\right]}  }\right]}  \nonumber \\
      \implies  a_n &= \sum^{k}_{n= 0} {\left[{ k_im_i^n }\right]}     \nonumber \\ \nonumber
\square
\end{align}

This can be verified by the fibonacci sequence as shown in section \ref{solving-the-sequence}, the solution to the characteristic equation is \(m_1 = \varphi, m_2 = {\left({ 1-\varphi }\right)}\) and the corresponding solution to the linear ODE and recursive relation are:

\begin{alignat}{4}
    f{\left({ x }\right)} &= &c_1 e^{\varphi x} +  &c_2 e^{{\left({ 1-\varphi }\right)} x}, \quad &\exists c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C} \nonumber \\
    \iff  a_n &= &k_1 n^{\varphi} +  &k_2 n^{1- \varphi}, &\exists k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C} \nonumber
\end{alignat}
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Repeated Roots of Characteristic Equation}
\label{rep-roots-recurrence}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Example
\label{sec:orgd58b80f}
Consider the following recurrence relation:

\begin{align}
    a_{n+2} -  10a_{n+ 1} +  25a_{n}&= 0 \label{eq:hom-repeated-roots-recurrence} \\
    \implies  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_{n+2} \frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]} - 10 \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_{n+1} \frac{x^n}{n!}    }\right]} + 25 \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0 }   {\left[{  a_{n}\frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]}&= 0 \nonumber
\end{align}

By applying the definition of the exponential generating function at \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-1} :

\begin{align}
    f''{\left({ x }\right)}- 10f'{\left({ x }\right)}+  25f{\left({ x }\right)}= 0 \label{eq:rep-roots-func-ode}
\end{align}

By implementing the already well-established theory of linear ODE's, the
characteristic equation for \eqref{eq:rep-roots-func-ode} can be expressed as:

\begin{align}
    m^2- 10m+  25 = 0 \nonumber \\
    {\left({ m- 5 }\right)}^2 = 0 \nonumber \\
    m= 5 \label{eq:rep-roots-recurrence-char-sol}
\end{align}

Herein lies a complexity, in order to solve this, the solution produced from \eqref{eq:rep-roots-recurrence-char-sol} can be used with the \emph{Reduction of Order} technique to produce a solution that will be of the form \cite[\textsection 4.3]{zillMatrixExponential2009}.

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)}= c_1e^{5x} +  c_2 x e^{5x} \label{eq:rep-roots-ode-sol}
\end{align}

\eqref{eq:rep-roots-ode-sol} can be expressed in terms of the exponential power series in order to try and relate the solution for the function back to the generating function,
observe however the following power series identity (proof in section \ref{prove-general-exp-identity}):

\begin{align}
    x^ke^x &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= k}   {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{{\left({ n- k }\right)}!} }\right]}, \quad \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \label{eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident}
\end{align}

by applying identity \eqref{eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident} to equation \eqref{eq:rep-roots-ode-sol}

\begin{align}
    \implies  f{\left({ x }\right)} &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ c_1 \frac{{\left({ 5x }\right)}^n}{n!} }\right]}  +  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 1}   {\left[{ c_2 n \frac{{\left({ 5x }\right)^n}}{n{\left({ n-1 }\right)}!} }\right]} \nonumber \\
 &= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!} {\left({ c_{1}5^n +  c_2 n 5^n   }\right)} }\right]} \nonumber
\end{align}

Given the defenition of the exponential generating function from \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-1}

\begin{align}
    f{\left({ x }\right)}&=     \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]} \nonumber \\
    \iff a_n &= c_{1}5^n +  c_{2}5^n \nonumber \\ \nonumber
    \ \nonumber \\
    \square \nonumber
\end{align}

\item Proof
\label{sec:org6704def}
Consider a recurrence relation of the form:

\begin{align}
     \sum^{k}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ c_i a_n }\right]}  = 0 \nonumber \\
      \implies  \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   c_i a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} = 0 \nonumber \\
      \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   c_i a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} \nonumber
\end{align}

By substituting for the value of the generating function from \eqref{eq:exp-gen-def-1}:

\begin{align}
    \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ c_if^{{\left({ k }\right)}}  {\left({ x }\right)}    }\right]} \label{eq:gen-form-rep-roots-ode}
\end{align}

Assume that \eqref{eq:gen-form-rep-roots-ode} corresponds to a charecteristic polynomial with only 1 root of multiplicity \(k\), the solution would hence be of the form:

\begin{align}
			 & \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ c_i m^i }\right]} = 0 \wedge m=B, \enspace  \exists! B \in \mathbb{C} \nonumber \\
 \implies      f{\left({ x }\right)}&= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ x^i A_i e^{mx} }\right]}, \quad \exists A \in \mathbb{C}^+, \enspace \forall i \in {\left[{ 1,k }\right]} \cap \mathbb{N}  \label{eq:sol-rep-roots-ode}
\end{align}

If we assume the identity from \eqref{eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident}:

\begin{align}
x^k e^x = \sum^{\infty}_{n= k} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{{\left({ n- k }\right)}!} }\right]}  \nonumber
\end{align}

See section \ref{prove-general-exp-identity} for proof.

We can apply identity \eqref{eq:uniq-roots-pow-series-ident} to \eqref{eq:sol-rep-roots-ode}, which gives:

\begin{align}
f{\left({ x }\right)}&=     \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ A_i \sum^{\infty}_{n= i}   {\left[{ \frac{{\left({ x m }\right)}^n}{{\left({ n- i }\right)}!} }\right]}  }\right]} \nonumber \\
&=     \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ \sum^{k}_{i=0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}  \frac{n!}{{\left({ n- i }\right)!}} A_i m^n }\right]}       }\right]} \nonumber \\
&=     \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0} {\left[{ \frac{x^n}{n!}   \sum^{k}_{i=0} {\left[{  \frac{n!}{{\left({ n- i }\right)!}} A_i m^n }\right]}       }\right]} \nonumber
\end{align}

Recall the generating function that was used to get \eqref{eq:gen-form-rep-roots-ode}:

\begin{align}
f{\left({ x }\right)}&= \sum^{\infty}_{n= 0}   {\left[{ a_n \frac{x^n}{n!} }\right]}      \nonumber \\
 \implies  a_n &= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ A_i \frac{n!}{{\left({ n- i }\right)}!} m^n  }\right]} \nonumber \\
 &= \sum^{k}_{i= 0}   {\left[{ m^n A_i \prod_{0}^{k} {\left[{ n- {\left({ i- 1 }\right)} }\right]}   }\right]}
& \intertext{$\because \enspace i \leq k$} \notag \nonumber \\
 &= \sum^{k}_{i= 0} {\left[{ A_i^* m^n n^i }\right]}, \quad \exists A_i \in \mathbb{C}, \enspace \forall i\leqk \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \nonumber \\
\ \nonumber \\
\square \nonumber
\end{align}

\item Proof
\label{prove-general-exp-identity}
In this section the proof of
\begin{enumerate}
\item Motivation
\label{sec:org9907579}

Consider the function \(f(x) = xe^x\). Using the taylor series formula we get the following:

\begin{align*}
    xe^x &= 0+\frac{1}{1!}x+\frac{2}{2!}x^2+\frac{3}{3!}x^3+\frac{4}{4!}x^4+\frac{5}{5!}x^5+\dots\\
    &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{nx^n}{n!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{(n-1)!}
\end{align*}

Similarly, \(f(x) = x^2e^x\) will give:
\begin{align*}
    x^2e^x &= \frac{0}{0!} + \frac{0x}{1!} + \frac{2x^2}{2!} + \frac{6x^3}{3!} + \frac{12x^4}{4!} + \frac{20x^5}{5!} + \dots\\
    &= \frac{2\cdot 1x^2}{2!} + \frac{3\cdot 2 x^3}{3!} + \frac{4\cdot 3x^4}{4!} + \frac{5\cdot 4 x^5}{5!} + \dots\\
    &= \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)x^n}{n!}\\
    &= \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{x^n}{(n-2)!}
\end{align*}

We conjecture thatIf we continue this on, we get:

\begin{align*}
    x^ke^x = \sum_{n=k}^\infty \frac{x^n}{(n-k)!} \quad \text{for}~k\in \mathbb{Z^{+}}\cap0
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{General Proof}
\label{general-gen-func-proof}
In sections \ref{uniq-roots-recurrence} and \ref{rep-roots-recurrence}
it was shown that a recurrence relation can be related to an ODE and then that
solution can be transformed to provide a solution for the recurrence relation.
This was shown in two separate cases, one with unique roots and the other with
repeated roots. However, in many circumstances the solutions to the characteristics
equation are a combination of both unique and repeated roots. Hence, in general the
solution to a linear ODE will be a superposition of solutions for each root, repeated
or unique and so a goal of our research will be to put this together to find a general
solution for homogenous linear recurrence relations.

Sketching out an approach for this:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use the Generating function to get an ODE
\item The ODE will have a solution that is a combination of the above two forms
\item The solution will translate back to a combination of both above forms
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Power Series Combination
\label{power-series-comb}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Proving with the Monotone Convergence Theorem}
\label{sec:org1430b75}
By Solving the Fibonacci Sequence using the Monotone Converge Theorem we can show that it is related to \(e\)
\subsection{Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio}
\label{fib-golden-ratio-proof}
The \emph{Fibonacci Sequence} is actually very interesting, observe that the ratios of the terms converge to the \emph{Golden Ratio}:

\begin{align*}
    F_n &= \frac{\varphi^n-\psi^n}{\varphi-\psi} = \frac{\varphi^n-\psi^n}{\sqrt 5} \\
    \iff \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}	&= \frac{\varphi^{n+ 1} - \psi^{n+  1}}{\varphi^{n} - \psi^{n}} \\
    \iff \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} \right]	&= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \frac{\varphi^{n+ 1} - \psi^{n+  1}}{\varphi^{n} - \psi^{n}} \right] \\
&= \frac{\varphi^{n+ 1} -\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \psi^{n +  1} \right] }{\varphi^{n} - \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left[ \psi^n \right] } \\
\text{because $\mid \psi \mid < 0$ $n \rightarrow \infty \implies \psi^{n} \rightarrow 0$:} \\
&= \frac{\varphi^{n+  1} -  0}{\varphi^{n} -  0} \\
&= \varphi
\end{align*}

We'll come back to this later on when looking at spirals and fractals.

We hope to demonstrate this relationship between the ratio of successive terms
of the fibonacci sequence without relying on ODEs and generating functions and
by instead using limits and the \emph{Monotone Convergence Theorem}, the hope being
that this will reveal deeper underlying relationships between the \emph{Fibonacci
Sequence}, the \emph{Golden Ratio} and there occurrences in nature (such as the
example in section \ref{sunflower-example} given that the both appear to occur in
patterns observed in nature.

We also hope to find a method to produce the the diagram shown in figure
computationally, ideally by using the Turtle function in \emph{Julia}.

\subsubsection{Fibonacci Sequence in Nature (This may be Removed)}
\label{sunflower-example}
The distribution of sunflower seeds is an example of the \emph{Fibonacci Sequence}
occuring in a pattern observed in nature (see Figure \ref{sunflower}).

Imagine that the process a sunflower follows when placing seeds is as follows: \footnote{This process is simply conjecture, other than seeing a very nice example at \href{https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html}{\emph{MathIsFun.com}}
\cite{NatureGoldenRatio2018}, we have no evidence to suggest that this is the way
that sunflowers distribute there seeds.

However the simulations performed within \emph{Julia} are very encouraging and
suggest that this process isn't too far off.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Place a seed
\item Move some small unit away from the origin
\item Rotate some constant angle \(\mathtt{\theta}\) (or θ) from the previous seed (with respect to the origin).
\item Repeat this process until a seed hits some outer boundary.
\end{enumerate}

This process can be simulated in Julia \cite{bezansonJuliaFreshApproach2017} as shown in listing \ref{simulate-sunflower},\footnote{Emojis and UTF8 were used in this code, and despite using \texttt{xelatex} with \texttt{fontspec} they aren't rendering properly, we intend to have this rectified in time for final submission.} which combined with \emph{ImageMagick} (see e.g. \ref{montage-frac}), produces output as shown in figure \ref{simulate-sunflower-image} and \ref{simulate-sunflower-phi}.

A distribution of seeds undder this process would be optimal if the amount of empty space was minimised, spirals, stars and swirls contain patterns compromise this.

To minimize this, the proportion of the circle traversed in step 3 must be an
irrational number, however this alone is not sufficent, the decimal values must
also be not to approximated by a rational number, for example
\cite{NatureGoldenRatio2018}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\pi \mod 1 \approx \frac{1}{7}=0.7142857142857143\)
\item \(e \mod 1 \approx \frac{5}{7}= 0.14285714285714285\)
\end{itemize}

It can be seen by simulation that \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) (because \(\phi \mod 1 =
\psi\)) are solutions to this optimisation problem as shown in figure
\ref{simulate-sunflower-phi}, this solution is unstable, a very minor change to the
value will result in patterns re-emerging in the distribution.

Another interesting property is that the number of spirals that appear to rotate
clockwise and anti-clockwise appear to be fibonacci numbers. Connecting this
occure with the relationship between the \emph{Fibonacci Sequence} as discussed in
section \ref{fib-golden-ratio-proof} is something we hope to look at in this project.
Illustrating this phenomena with \emph{Julia} by finding the mathematics to colour
the correct spirals is also something we intend to look at in this project.

The bottom right spiral in figure \ref{simulate-sunflower-image} has a ratio of rotation of \(\frac{1}{\pi}\), the spirals look similar to one direction of the spirals occuring in figure \ref{simulate-sunflower-phi}, it is not clear if there is any significance to this similarity.

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org808ad38}
Julia sets are a very interesting fractal and we hope to investigate them further in this project.
\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:org71d5e66}
Consider the iterative process \(x \rightarrow x^{2}, \enspace x \in \mathbb{R}\),
for values of \(x>1\) this process will diverge and for \(x<1\) it will converge.

Now Consider the iterative process \(z \rightarrow z^{2}, \enspace z \in \mathbb{C}\),
for values of \(\left\lvert z \right\rvert >1\) this process will diverge and for \(\left\lvert z \right\rvert <1\) it will converge.

Although this seems trivial this can be generalised.

Consider:

\begin{itemize}
\item The complex plane for \(\left\lvert z \right\rvert \leq 1\)
\item Some function \(f_{c}(z) = z^{2} + c, \quad c \leq 1 \in \mathbb{C}\) that can be used to iterate with
\end{itemize}

Every value on that plane will belong to one of the two following sets

\begin{itemize}
\item \(P_{c}\)
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of values on the plane that converge to zero (prisoners)
\item Define \(Q^{(k)}_{c}\) to be the the set of values confirmed as prisoners after \(k\) iterations of \(f_{c}\)
\begin{itemize}
\item this implies \(\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left[ Q^{(k)}_{c}  \right] = P_{c}\)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \(E_{c}\)
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of values on the plane that tend to \(\infty\) (escapees)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the case of \(f_{0}(z) = z^{2}\) all values \(\left\lvert z  \right \rvert \leq 1\) are bounded with \(\left\lvert z  \right \rvert = 1\) being an unstable stationary circle, but let's investigate what happens for different iterative functions like \(f_{1}(z) = z^{2} - 1\), despite how trivial this seems at first glance.

\subsection{Plotting the Sets}
\label{sec:org7d25f70}
Although the convergence of values may appear simple at first, we'll implement a
strategy to plot the prisoner and escape sets on the complex plane.

Because this involves iteration and \emph{Python} is a little slow, We'll denote
complex values as a vector\footnote{See figure for the obligatory \emph{XKCD} Comic} and define the operations as described in
listing \ref{complex-vec}.\footnote{This technique was adapted from Chapter 7 of \emph{Math adventures with Python} \cite{farrellMathAdventuresPython2019}}

To implement this test we'll consider a function called \texttt{escape\_test} that applies an
iteration (in this case \(f_{0}: z \rightarrow z^{2}\)) until that value diverges or converges.

While iterating with \(f_{c}\) once \(\left\lvert z \right\rvert >
\mathrm{max}\left(\left\{c, 2\}\right)\), the value must diverge because
\(\left\lvert c \rvert\right \leq 1\), so rather than record whether or not the
value converges or diverges, the \texttt{escape\_test} can instead record the number of
iterations \((k)\) until the value has crossed that boundary and this will provide
a measurement of the rate of divergence.

Then the \texttt{escape\_test} function can be mapped over a matrix, where each element
of that matrix is in turn mapped to a point on the cartesian plane, the resulting matrix
can be visualised as an image \footnote{these cascading values are much like brightness in Astronomy}, this is implemented in listing
\ref{py-circle-code} and the corresponding output shown in \ref{py-circle-plot}.

with respect to listing \ref{py-circle-code}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Observe that the \texttt{magnitude} function wasn't used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item This is because a \texttt{sqrt} is a costly operation and comparing two squares saves an operation
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\caption{\label{py-circle-plot}Circle of Convergence for \(f_{0}: z \rightarrow z^{2}\)}

This is precisely what we expected, but this is where things get interesting,
consider now the result if we apply this same procedure to \(f_{1}: z \rightarrow
z^{2} - 1\) or something arbitrary like \(f_{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{i}{2}}: z
\rightarrow z^{2} + (\frac{1}{4} + \frac{i}{2})\), the result is something
remarkebly unexpected, as shown in figures \ref{py-jl-1-plot} and \ref{py-jl-rab-plot}.

\end{figure}

To investigate this further consider the
more general function \(f_{0.8 e^{\pi i \tau}}: z \rightarrow z^{2} + 0.8 e^{\pi
i \tau}, \enspace \tau \in \mathbb{R}\), many fractals can be generated using
this set by varying the value of \(\tau\)\footnote{This approach was inspired by an animation on the \emph{Julia Set} Wikipedia article \cite{JuliaSet2020}}.

\emph{Python} is too slow for this, but the \emph{Julia} programming language, as a
compiled language, is significantly faster and has the benefit of treating
complex numbers as first class citizens, these images can be generated in
\emph{Julia} in a similar fashion as before, with the specifics shown in listing
\ref{julia-gen-fracs}. The \texttt{GR} package appears to be the best plotting library
performance wise and so was used to save corresponding images to disc, this is
demonstrated in listing \ref{GR-save} where 1200 pictures at a 2.25 MP resolution were produced. \footnote{On my system this took about 30 minutes.}

A subset of these images can be combined using \emph{ImageMagick} and \texttt{bash} to
create a collage, \emph{ImageMagick} can also be used to produce an animation but it often
fails and a superior approach is to use \texttt{ffmpeg}, this is demonstrated in
listing \ref{bash-frac-join}, the collage is shown in figure \ref{montage-frac} and a corresponding
animation is \href{https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/rbu25urfg8sbwfu/out.gif?dl=0}{available online}\footnote{\href{https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/rbu25urfg8sbwfu/out.gif?dl=0}{https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/rbu25urfg8sbwfu/out.gif?dl=0}}].

\section{MandelBrot Set}
\label{sec:org576f797}
Investigating these fractals, a natural question might be whether or not any
given \(c\) value will produce a fractal that is an open disc or a closed disc.

So pick a value \(\left\lvert \gamma \right \rvert < 1\) in the complex plane and
use it to produce the julia set \(f_{\gamma}\), if the corresponding prisoner set
\(P\) is closed we this value is defined as belonging to the \emph{Mandelbrot} set.

It can be shown (and I intend to show it generally), that this set is equivalent to re-implementing the previous strategy such that \(z \rightarrow z^{2} + z_{0}\) where \(z_{0}\) is unchanging or more clearly as a seqeuence:

\begin{align}
z_{n+1} &= z^{2}_n + c \label{eq:mb-sequence} \\
z_{0}   &= c
\end{align}

This strategy is implemented in listing and produces the output shown in figure \ref{mandelbrot-py-pic}.

    z1 = z
    # Iterate num times
    while count <= num:
        # check for divergence
        if magnitude(z1) > 2.0:
            #return the step it diverged on
            return count

This output although remarkable is however fairly undetailed, by using \emph{Julia} a much
larger image can be produced, in \emph{Julia} producing a 4 GB, 400 MP image can be done in little time
(about 10 minutes on my system), this is demonstrated in listing 
and the corresponding FITS image is \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/jd5qf1pi2h68f2c/mandelbrot-400mpx.fits?dl=0}{available-online.}\footnote{\href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/jd5qf1pi2h68f2c/mandelbrot-400mpx.fits?dl=0}{https://www.dropbox.com/s/jd5qf1pi2h68f2c/mandelbrot-400mpx.fits?dl=0}}

\subsection{Resources Used for the Hausdorff Dimension}
\label{haus-resource}
Research for \S \ref{Hausdorff-dimension} on the Hausdorff Dimension proved actually to be quite difficult, while much information is available online, precice and clear explanations of the Hausdorff dimension are difficult to find without scouring texts, the following proved very helpful generally in preparing for this topic and I would strongly recommend these chapters as a starting point for further reading on this topic:
