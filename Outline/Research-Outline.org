Here's what I gatthered from the week 3 slides

* Give a brief Sketch of the project

** Topic / Context

** Motivation

** Basic Ideas
- Look at FOSS CAS Systems
  - Python (Sympy)
  - Julia
    - Sympy integration
    - symEngine
    - Reduce.jl
    - Symata.jl

- Maybe look at interactive sessions:
  - Like Jupyter
  - Hydrogen
  - TeXmacs
  - org-mode?

After getting an overview of SymPy let's look at problems that are interesting (chaos, morphogenesis and order from disarray etc.)


** Where are the Mathematics

- Trying to look at the algorithms underlying functions in Python/Sympy and other Computer algebra tools such as Maxima, Maple, Mathematica, Sage, GAP and Xcas/Giac, Yacas, Symata.jl, Reduce.jl, SymEngine.jl
  - For Example Recursive Relations
- Look at solving some problems related to chaos theory maybe
  - Mandelbrot and Julia Sets
- Look at solving some problems related to Fourier Transforms maybe


AVOID DETAILS, JUST SKETCH THE PROJECT OUT.


** Don't Forget we need a talk
*** Slides In Org Mode
- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentations.html][Without Beamer]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html][With Beamer]]

* What we're looking for

- Would a reader know what the project is about?
- Would a reader become interested in the upcoming report?
- Is it brief but well prepared?
- Are the major parts or phases sketched out



* Download RevealJS
So first do ~M-x package-install ox-reveal~ then do ~M-x load-library~ and then look for ~ox-reveal~

Download Reveal.js and put it in the directory as ~./reveal.js~, you can do that with something like this:

#+begin_src bash
# cd /home/ryan/Dropbox/Studies/2020Spring/QuantProject/Current/Python-Quant/Outline/
wget https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -xzvf master.tar.gz && rm master.tar.gz
mv reveal.js-master reveal.js
#+end_src

Then just do ~C-c e e R R~ to export with RevealJS as opposed to PHP you won't need a fancy server, just open it in the browser.
