Von Neumann′s quantum-mechanical entropy S(A) of a density-matrix A can be written S(A) = −log[det(AA)]. Using convexity, an obvious generalization of S(A), namely −log[det(AAAA)], is shown to satisfy the same monotonicity inequality as S(A). Matrix-matrix exponentiation is used to generalize several results about iterated exponentiation of scalars.},

  abstract = {An experiment involving more than 500 responses from over 250 subjects was conducted for the purpose of identifying differences in debugging performance among subjects who debugged iterative code and those who debugged recursive code. The subjects, classified as novices or experienced, based on programming experience, were asked to locate and fix a single logical bug in small segments of C code. Two different tasks – searching a linked list and copying a linked list, were used in the experiment. Statistical analyses yielded the following significant results: (i) 63.2\% of all subjects located the bug in the recursive constructs compared to 41.5\% for the iterative constructs (p{$<$}.00001); (ii) Grouped by task, and level of programmer experience, there were significantly more correct responses for the recursive code than for the iterative code (p{$<$}.02 in all four groupings); (iii) In terms of locating and fixing the bug, more responses were correct for the recursive version of the copy task than for the iterative version (p=.01875). Results of a t-test procedure showed no significant difference between the iterative and recursive constructs in terms of mean times needed for successful completion of the debugging tasks.},

  abstract = {This textbook introduces the vast array of features and powerful mathematical functions of Mathematica using a multitude of clearly presented examples and worked-out problems. Each section starts with a description of a new topic and some basic examples. The author then demonstrates the use of new commands through three categories of problems - the first category highlights those essential parts of the text that demonstrate the use of new commands in Mathematica whilst solving each problem presented; - the second comprises problems that further demonstrate the use of commands previously introduced to tackle different situations; and - the third presents more challenging problems for further study. The intention is to enable the reader to learn from the codes, thus avoiding long and exhausting explanations. While based on a computer algebra course taught to undergraduate students of mathematics, science, engineering and finance, the book also includes chapters on calculus and solving equations, and graphics, thus covering all the basic topics in Mathematica. With its strong focus upon programming and problem solving, and an emphasis on using numerical problems that do not need any particular background in mathematics, this book is also ideal for self-study and as an introduction to researchers who wish to use Mathematica as a computational tool. This new edition has been extensively revised and updated, and includes new chapters with problems and worked examples},

  abstract = {Measurement of graph centrality provides us with an indication of the importance or popularity of each vertex in a graph. When dealing with graphs that are not centrally controlled (such as the Web, social networks and academic citation graphs), centrality measure must 1) correlate with vertex importance/popularity, 2) scale well in terms of computation, and 3) be difficult to manipulate by individuals. The Random Surfer probability transition model, combined with Eigenvalue Centrality produced PageRank, which has shown to satisfy the required properties. Existing centrality measures (including PageRank) make the assumption that all directed edges are positive, implying an endorsement. Recent work on sentiment analysis has shown that this assumption is not valid. In this article, we introduce a new method of transitioning a graph, called Power Walk, that can successfully compute centrality scores for graphs with real weighted edges. We show that it satisfies the desired properties, and that its computation time and centrality ranking is similar to when using the Random Surfer model for non-negative matrices. Finally, stability and convergence analysis shows us that both stability and convergence when using the power method, are dependent on the Power Walk parameter β.},
